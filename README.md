# Heroes Bot

## Commands

### Players
Find players on hotslogs with the `!player [battletag]` command. Example `!player Applepie#11536`

### Teams
You can query whole teams with the `!team [battletag1] ... [battletag 5]` command. **Note: You currently need to list exactly 5 players for this command. A Future release will change this to any number**

## Additional features and contributions

There are some features I would like to add but either HOTS Logs API does not provision that information or I have not yet gotten a chance. There is a list here of some of these features. If anyone is willing or interested in contributing, you are more than welcome. Let me know and I will mark it as in progress.

### Data
